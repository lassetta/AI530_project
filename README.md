AI530 project

The CSV results and the training and evaluation scripts for the rectilinear scripts are in 
the experiments-rectilinear-data folder and for the fisheye they are in experiments-fisheye-data

These folders are broken into subfolders that contain the following:
MLPaug
CNNaug
ATTNaug
Resnetaug
Pretrained

The pretrained folder contains all of the pretrained model scripts to run the pretrained models.

The results and graphs are in the res folder, which pulls from the results of the two experiment-data-type
folders. The graphs are included in those folders
